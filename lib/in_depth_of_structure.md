Core Layer
1. Network Layer (api_service.dart, dio_client.dart, exceptions.dart)
Your networking structure is solid. However, here are some refinements:

✅ Enhancements for api_service.dart:

Implement generic API response handling using a base response model. Instead of handling responses in every API call separately, create a BaseResponse<T> class that wraps success and failure responses.
Introduce a retry mechanism to reattempt requests after failures. This is useful for transient errors (e.g., network timeouts).
Support cancellation tokens to cancel ongoing requests when switching screens to improve resource efficiency.
✅ Enhancements for dio_client.dart:

Set up global error logging via Dio interceptors. Every request and response should be logged for debugging.
Include OAuth2.0 token refresh handling in interceptors. When an API fails due to an expired token, automatically refresh it and retry the request.
✅ Enhancements for exceptions.dart:

Create custom API response exceptions instead of just generic exceptions. For example, define:
NetworkException for connectivity issues.
TimeoutException for request timeouts.
UnauthorizedException for authentication failures.
2. Utils (validators.dart, constants.dart, theme.dart, storage.dart)
✅ Enhancements for validators.dart:

Make validation functions extensible by allowing custom validation rules (e.g., validate(String input, List<ValidationRule> rules)).
✅ Enhancements for constants.dart:

Consider using environment variables (.env files) for configuration instead of hardcoding API keys in constants.dart.
✅ Enhancements for theme.dart:

Ensure dark mode and theming support using ThemeMode.system, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes dynamically.
✅ Enhancements for storage.dart:

Support encrypted storage (e.g., using flutter_secure_storage for sensitive data).
3. Dependency Injection (dependency_injection.dart)
✅ Enhancements for dependency_injection.dart:

Instead of only using GetIt, consider integrating Riverpod or Injectable for better compile-time safety and tree-shaking support.
Use LazySingletons for expensive objects (like Dio client) to avoid unnecessary memory allocation.
4. Routes (auth_routes.dart, main_routes.dart, app_router.dart)
✅ Enhancements for app_router.dart:

Introduce route guards to restrict navigation based on authentication state.
Consider deep linking support to handle URLs and in-app navigation.
Features Layer – Authentication Module
1. Data Sub-Layer
✅ Enhancements for auth_remote_datasource.dart:

If the API supports it, enable WebSockets for real-time authentication updates (e.g., session expiration notifications).
Implement exponential backoff for retrying failed requests instead of retrying immediately.
✅ Enhancements for user_models.dart:

Make User model immutable (@immutable) and use copyWith() for updates.
Add fromMap() and toMap() functions for easy serialization/deserialization.
✅ Enhancements for auth_repository_impl.dart:

Separate remote and local authentication handling. Local caching can be used for "remember me" functionality.
2. Domain Sub-Layer
✅ Enhancements for user.dart:

If the user has roles (e.g., admin, guest, user), define Role-based Access Control (RBAC) in this entity.
✅ Enhancements for auth_repository.dart:

Keep this fully abstract, making it easy to swap implementations (e.g., Firebase authentication instead of REST).
✅ Enhancements for login_usecase.dart, signup_usecase.dart:

Support multi-factor authentication (MFA) by extending the use case.
3. Presentation Sub-Layer
✅ Enhancements for login_blocs.dart:

Introduce stateful error messages instead of general error handling.
Optimize state management: Instead of loading UI on every state change, batch multiple state updates before notifying listeners.
✅ Enhancements for login_page.dart, signup_page.dart:

Improve accessibility by adding labels for text fields.
✅ Enhancements for viewmodels (login_viewmodel.dart, signup_viewmodel.dart):

Decouple business logic from UI by keeping viewmodels as lightweight as possible.
Additional Suggestions for Architecture Improvements
1. Security Enhancements
JWT token expiration handling: Automatically log out users when tokens expire.
Secure storage: Store tokens and sensitive data in encrypted storage instead of SharedPreferences.
Prevent data leakage: Strip logs of sensitive data before printing.
2. Performance Optimizations
Lazy loading data instead of fetching everything at once.
Use Flutter Isolates for heavy computations to avoid UI jank.
3. Scalability Considerations
If the app expands, introduce microservices (e.g., separate modules for payments, notifications).
Consider using a monorepo structure if working in a large team.
